    <h1>HTML Abbreviation (abbr) Examples</h1>
    <h4 style="color: red;">
        <b>
            Note: The 'acronym' tag also allows authors to clearly indicate a sequence of characters
            that compose an acronym or abbreviation for a word, but the feature is obsolete since 
            it is not supported in HTML5. Try to avoid using it.
