     Correct usage when citing a title:

     According to the Wikipedia article <cite>University of California, San Diego</cite>, 
     UCSD was established in 1960.

     An example of using &lt;cite&gt; in a bibliography (but remember, only use around the title):

     Fitzgerald, F S. <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite>. New York: Scribner Paperback Fiction, 1995. Print.

     Here is an example if you want to quote an article with its source (remember never to cite the autor as the work title):

     According to the NCBI article <cite>Impact of computer use on children's eyes</cite> by N. Kozeis, <q>Extensive viewing of the computer 
     screen can lead to eye discomfort, fatigue, blurred vision and headaches, dry eyes and other symptoms of eyestrain.</q>
